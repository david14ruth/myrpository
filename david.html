            What Is a Web Programmer?
            A web programmer is responsible for the development <br>and planning of a website’s execution.<br> Your job duties include focusing on
             the actual code of the website to meet design specifications. <br>You take a design sheet and write up a software algorithm to determine how best 
             to translate it into code, and can work independently or as part of a team<br>. If you work as part of a team, you have one of the most important jobs in the
              creation of the site. A web programmer needs to develop multiple <br>proficiencies and gain experience with various websites.
            How to Become a Web Programmer
            Most organizations expect you to have a bachelor’s degree in web<br> development or a similar tech qualification, but it isn’t always necessary
            . If you can point potential employers to your own work,<br> it’s possible to get the job even without a degree. To acquire skills,
             you need to learn a variety of web programming languages like Javascript, HTML5, Ruby, Python, and Perl. Once you 
             learn these languages, you can start building web pages and <br>add them to your design portfolio.
            How to Be a Good Web Programmer
            To be successful in your career as a web programmer,<br> you need to plan your code before<br> you start creating it. It’s 
            important to learn the intricacies of the language in which you are coding and plan to make mistakes. When creating your
             work timetable, you should always build debugging time into it,<br> because having code run perfectly the first time is unlikely. The more complex the website, the more bugs are likely to exist in the code.

           <p>Systems developer vs. application developer
            Software engineers will usually fall into one of two categories,<br> systems developers or application developers. 
            As a systems developer (sometimes called a backend engineer),<br> you’ll build things like computer systems
             and networks that front-end (user-facing) applications will need. You can do this by:
            •	Ensuring that different types of software <br>programs communicate with each other on one platform
            •	Creating and enforcing IT standards within an infrastructure 
            •	Maintaining documentation of IT systems 
            •	Updating to new technologies as needed
            •	Collaborating with development teams, <br>senior systems architects, and data science professionals 
            Working as an application developer is more<br> client-focused. You may work on either the front or 
            back end of the system, designing software<br> that the end user will interact with. Tasks might include:
            •	Developing applications for iOS, Android, Windows, or other operating systems
            •	Conducting an analysis of requirements and tweaking software as needed
            •	Releasing software updates
            •	Working with graphic designers, customer <br>service staff, project managers, and other customer-facing departments
